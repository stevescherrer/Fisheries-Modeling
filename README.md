# Fisheries Modeling
 A collection of scripts for modeling fish and fisheries. 
 Files include an assortment of coursework, tutorials, and dissertation projects. 
 
 This collection is by no means the extent of my abilities, but rather a portfolio of proficiency for models common in fisheries science.
